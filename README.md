## How It Works

Doc Autobot works by scanning your project's files and using the Gemini AI to understand the purpose and functionality of your code. It then uses this understanding to generate a `README.md` file that accurately describes your project. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is generated from a standardized template that can be easily customized.


## Configuration

To enable AI-powered `README.md` generation, you must provide a Google Gemini API key.

1.  Obtain your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Create a `.env` file in the directory **where you run the `doc-autobot` command**.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
```

Replace `your_api_key` with your actual Gemini API key.

## Get Started

    ```
    Replace `your_api_key` with your actual Gemini API key. Obtain your key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
